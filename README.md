# Give Me Some Credit on Redis

This repository has all the code to build a machine learning model with scikit-learn that solves the Give Me Some Credit challenge on Kaggle. Once it builds the model, it will convert it to an ONNX model which can be hosted on RedisAI.

## Step 1: Get Some Data

I can't host the data here as it belongs to others. You will need to download it yourself, unzip it, and place the .csv files in the data folder. You can download it here from the Kaggle [challenge page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/GiveMeSomeCredit/data).
